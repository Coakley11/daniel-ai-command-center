**Last updated:** 2026-06-03

Actionable work items. Master context: [app_roadmap.md](./app_roadmap.md).

---

# Project Description

Central hub repo (`daniel-ai-command-center`) for suite homepage, activity aggregation, Supabase account memory, and shared modules synced to sibling apps.

---

# Current Priorities

### P0 — Documentation & roadmap system

- [x] Create `cursor-prompts/` roadmap system (this commit)
- [x] Add `.cursor/rules/command-center-roadmap-docs.mdc`
- [ ] Link root [README.md](../README.md) → `cursor-prompts/app_roadmap.md`

### P1 — Activity Feed Phase B (local / uncommitted)

- [ ] Review and commit: `activity_time.py`, `activity_feed.py`, `activity_store.py`, `ai_command_center.py`, `homepage_sections.py`, suite storage clients, tests
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/test_activity_time.py tests/test_activity_dashboard.py tests/test_activity_feed_noise.py`
- [ ] Push `origin/dev` and verify homepage dev URL shows Today's Work / Highlights / Recent sections
- [ ] Bump `BUILD_VERSION` in `app_urls.py` after deploy

### P2 — Suite deploy & cross-device verification

- [ ] Confirm Command Center Streamlit Cloud branch = `dev`, secrets block complete, Reboot after secret changes
- [ ] Admin expander: `suite_activity section found` = true, Supabase reachable, pipeline status OK
- [ ] Cross-device test: phone Music event → laptop Command Center feed (see [docs/SUITE_DEV_DEPLOY.md](../docs/SUITE_DEV_DEPLOY.md) §5)
- [ ] Verify Baseball + Future Lens reset button on Cloud (`bc7dd0c`, `ab22c76` or later)

### P3 — Shared module hygiene

- [ ] After any `suite_*` edit here, run `python scripts/sync_suite_cloud_modules.py` and commit sibling repos as needed
- [ ] `python scripts/verify_account_memory.py` and `python scripts/verify_live_activity.py` locally

---

# Next Features

*(After P1–P2 or in parallel)*

- [ ] Data-driven Phase A verification table (one config for all apps)
- [ ] Homepage auto-refresh toggle or shorter cache TTL for connections probe
- [ ] Coach insights: ingest cloud `full_session` page/summary per app
- [ ] Update README to reflect live Supabase mode

---

# Long-Term Vision

*See [app_roadmap.md](./app_roadmap.md) and [app_feature_backlog.md](./app_feature_backlog.md).*

---

# Completed Features

Recent task completions (see [app_completed_features.md](./app_completed_features.md)):

- [x] Cross-device cloud session persistence (`full_session`) — build v29 (`47273c2`)
- [x] Account-memory deep links + `suite_resume_launch` (`6594dd4`)
- [x] Supabase account memory with `user_id` on writes (`5bff893`)
- [x] Roadmap documentation system (`cursor-prompts/`)

# Notes

- Work on branch **`dev`**; push `origin/dev` for Streamlit Cloud dev homepage.
- When a task ships, move detail to `app_completed_features.md` and uncheck here.

## Deployment checks

- [ ] Streamlit Cloud: repo `Coakley11/daniel-ai-command-center`, branch `dev`, main file `ai_command_center.py`
- [ ] Dev URL live: `HOMEPAGE_DEV_URL` in `app_urls.py`
- [ ] `[suite_activity]` secrets: `supabase_url`, `supabase_key`, `suite_user_id`, `suite_user_email`
- [ ] Migrations applied: `001_suite_activity.sql`, `002_suite_account_memory*.sql`, `003_suite_account_memory_resume.sql`
- [ ] Reboot app after secrets or migration changes

---

## Testing tasks

- [ ] `pytest` (full suite or at minimum activity + storage tests)
- [ ] `python scripts/verify_imports.py`
- [ ] `python scripts/verify_homepage_links.py`
- [ ] Manual: empty Supabase → empty states render without traceback
- [ ] Manual: inject test event (`scripts/inject_test_music_event.py`) → appears in feed
